# Feature Engineering Project

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to demonstrate various feature engineering techniques for handling missing values, dealing with imbalanced 
datasets, addressing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. These preprocessing methods are essential steps in preparing datasets
for machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.

## Methods Used

### 1. Handling Missing Values
- **Drop Rows/Columns:** Rows or columns with missing data are deleted to remove incomplete entries.
- **Mean/Median Imputation:** Missing values in numerical columns are filled using the mean or median value, depending on the data
-  distribution and presence of outliers.
- **Mode Imputation:** Missing values in categorical columns are imputed using the mode (most frequent value) of the column.

### 2. Handling Imbalanced Datasets
- **Upsampling:** Minority class samples are replicated to match the number of majority class samples, thus balancing the dataset.
- **Downsampling:** Random samples from the majority class are removed to match the number of samples in the minority class.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** Synthetic samples are generated by interpolating between existing minority
-  class samples to balance the dataset.

### 3. Handling Outliers
- **Box Plot Analysis:** A five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum) is used to detect and remove outliers based on the
-  interquartile range (IQR).

### 4. Data Encoding
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Categorical variables are converted into binary columns (dummy variables), where each unique value becomes a
- separate column.
- **Label Encoding:** Categorical variables are converted into integer values based on their labels.
- **Ordinal Encoding:** Categorical variables with an inherent order (e.g., small, medium, large) are mapped to integers.
- **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:** Categories are encoded based on the mean of the target variable for each category.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `imblearn`
